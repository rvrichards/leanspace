Steps to run Python code to submit a REST API call and a server to reply.

1. Create a local directory: leanspace.
2. Will need a test api server, using Flask: app.py
	- Server: localhost:5000
	- Endpoint: /api/endpoint666
3. Create a test csv file: leanspace.csv
4. Create a test Python file to submit REST api calls: leanspace.py
5. First coding - simple generic submit and reply code.
	- success, initial commit.
6. Add try-catch for errors.
7. Adding validation - found problems with my payload JSON, it's not correct, need to use column titles.
	- also factor out api_url so its not in function parameter list
	- validation added.
	- success and its working. Second commit.
